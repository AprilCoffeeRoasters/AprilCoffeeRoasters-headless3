        "question": "I just placed my order, when will it be dispatched?",
        "answer": "**Orders not containing coffee beans:**\nOrders that are not relying on our Roasting schedule and shipping with Fedex or DHL, usually ship in 1 or 2 business days.\n\n**Orders containing Coffee beans:**\nProduction is scheduled to occur every Tuesday & Wednesday. This means that if you have placed your order before 12:00 CEST on a Monday, your coffee will be roasted, packed and dispatched the following Tuesday of that week.\nIf your order is placed after 12:00 CEST on a Monday, your order will be carried over to the next subsequent production day. You will receive your tracking link via email once your order has been scheduled for production.\n\nNote that this is not relevant for subscription orders, please refer to the section below."

To make any desired changes, we must cancel your existing order and place a new order using your updated terms. Note that if you wish to cancel your order, you need to do it at the latest on the 48h before we fulfil it the following Monday.\n\n• If your order has already shipped, we are unable to cancel and refund the order.\n\n• Subscribers can easily modify their subscription by logging into their account and visiting the \"Subscriptions\" section of the dashboard. There, you can adjust settings like quantity, variety, or shipping preferences. Please note that any changes will only apply to future orders processed after the updates are made. Be sure to check your charge date to ensure the changes apply to the correct order."

Head on over to the Subscriptions section of your account dashboard and click the ‘Pause Subscription’ or \"cancel Subscription\" link.\n\n**Having a subscription does not automatically create an account**, so if you are struggling to log in, it is because you do not have an account yet."
