As we understand that our Store's setup is professional, you are welcome to use these recipes as a guide, and tune your equipment to achieve your perfect cup.\n\nWe are not able to give tailored recipes based on your equipment.",

        "- We use a reverse osmosis system, with a PPM usually between 25 and 50. We do not measure the exact composition of our water so we are not able to share that with you.\n\n- We are aware that not everyone has the same set up and our recipes might not be fully relevant to everyone. Unfortunately we are not able to offer solutions tailored to everyone's set up, as we might not use the same equipment as you are. Nonetheless, we trust that you are able to find your perfect recipe and get the most out of each cup.\n\n- We do not measure the particle size in our recipes, so we are not able to share these.",

        "The farmer decides the price and payment terms. It’s that simple.",

 question: "03 — QUALITY, TOGETHER",
      answer:
        "We define quality together through tasting, dialogue and clear expectations. April and the partner farmer agree on a clear range of quality acceptance before purchasing. We also agree in advance on how to handle unexpected quality issues, including problems that may occur at origin, without placing the financial risk on the farmer.",

       question: "06 — LOGISTICAL PARTNER",

        "We trade all our coffees with the support of a logistical partner. If a quality issue arises on arrival, April, the partner farmer and our logistical partner work together to find a solution without placing the farmer at financial risk.",
    },
    {
    question: "07 — #GROWINGTOGETHER",
      answer:
        "We believe long-term relationships, shared progress and shared responsibility lead to better coffee. There are exceptions when we begin a new relationship and initially source the coffee through an importer. Our current relationship with Kayon Mountain in Ethiopia is one example. We are at the beginning of that journey, with Café Imports facilitating the process. In these cases, we still maintain direct contact and build a relationship with the farmer. And if a farmer prefers to continue working through an importer—not every farmer wants to trade directly—we respect and support that choice.",
